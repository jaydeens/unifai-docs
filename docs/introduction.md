# Welcome to UnifAI Network

UnifAI Network provides infrastructure for building and deploying autonomous AI agents. The platform enables AI agents to discover, utilize, and interact with tools and services dynamically at runtime through a standardized API.

## What is UnifAI?

UnifAI is a platform that enhances AI agent capabilities through:

- **Dynamic Tool Discovery:** Agents find and use tools at runtime based on task requirements
- **Unified API:** Single integration point to access the entire tools ecosystem
- **Autonomous Operation:** Agents can search for tools, execute tasks, and manage operations independently
- **Model Compatibility:** Works with any LLM that supports function calling
- **Security-First Design:** Private keys and sensitive data remain client-side, with configurable access controls

## Core Components

- **Tools:** Executable functions that extend agent capabilities (e.g., data processing, API interactions, complex computations)
- **Toolkits:** Composable collections of tools that are dynamically served to agents based on context
- **Marketplace:** Decentralized registry where tools can be published, discovered, and utilized by other agents
- **SDK:** Available for JavaScript/TypeScript and Python, with support for both tool usage and toolkit creation

## Technical Benefits

UnifAI addresses common development challenges in AI agent systems:
- Empower agents to solve complex and dynamic tasks rather than pre-defined static ones
- Runtime tool discovery eliminates static dependencies
- Single API integration reduces implementation complexity
- Dynamic tool usage with latest versions without client updates
- Standardized inter-agent communication protocol
- Built-in marketplace mechanics for tool distribution

This documentation will guide you through implementing UnifAI Network in your projectsâ€”from initial setup and tool integration to creating and deploying your own toolkits.
