## Create a Strategy Execution Agent

### Write Your Prompt
You can describe the strategy you want to automate using human language (no coding required). Try to follow this format: **Trigger + Action**.

- **Triggers**: UniFAI supports time-based or price-based triggers.
  - **Time-based triggers**: Run strategies daily, hourly, or on custom schedules.
  - **Price-based triggers**: Execute actions automatically when a token's price hits a specific level.
- **Actions**: Can include fetching data, executing trades, or other logic. Be as precise as possible for best results.

#### Example: Meteora DLMM Automation Strategy
An example of an automated strategy for a Meteora DLMM pool:

**Every 4h**: Find DLMM pools with the following criteria:

- FDV: >= $10,000,000 and <= $300,000,000  
- TVL: >= $5,000  
- 24h fees: >= $5,000  
- Quote Token: SOL  
- Base Fee: >= 1%  
- Bin step: >=80 and <= 250  
- 24h fee/tvl >= 1%  
- 24h volume/liquidity > 1  
- Base Token Age: >= 48 hours  
- Base Token Price Change% 1h > 0  
- Base Token 1h Volume: >= $100,000  
- Base Token 24h Volume: >= $500,000  
- Base Token Liquidity: >= $300,000  
- Base Jupiter Organic Score: >= 65  
- Only keep one pool per token (keep the one with the higher 24h fee)  

**Execution Logic:**

- Add liquidity only if all conditions are met.  
- Skip if token already exists in current positions.  
- Limit of 5 positions per strategy.  

**Liquidity Settings:**

- Size: 0.5 SOL  
- Strategy: SOL single-sided, Bid-ask strategy, default price range  
- Real-time stop loss: PnL% -8%  
- Real-time take profit: PnL% +10%  
- Out of range: If current pool price is 5% above the max price range, remove liquidity, claim fees, and convert to SOL  

> Apart from take-profit, stop-loss, and out-of-range scenarios, do not remove liquidity under any other conditions.

Once the prompt is entered, the Agent converts it into an automated strategy for confirmation. Make sure the **Trigger** and **Instructions** match your needs. Modify them through the chat if necessary. Select the wallet you want to use for the strategy once everything is correct.

## Wallet Setup

### Create a Wallet
Click **Create Wallet** to generate a secure, Privy-powered crypto wallet.  

- Choose a **Solana** or **EVM** wallet  
- Name it to match your strategy  
- Alternatively, create a wallet directly when creating the agent  

### About the Wallet Private Keys
- You can withdraw any assets from the wallet  
- Privy custodial service securely stores private keys (even UniFAI team cannot access them)  
- Future updates will allow managing Agent Wallet assets through the chat interface  

### Fund Your Wallet
1. On the **Deposit** page, send funds to your wallet address.  
2. Select the correct blockchain network. Example:  
   - Solana for automated Meteora or meme coin strategies  
3. Deposit funds from an existing wallet or centralized exchange (CEX)  

⚠️ Always double-check the wallet address and blockchain network. Start with a small test transaction if unsure.

### Verify Your Balance
After the blockchain transaction confirms, check your wallet's balance on the **Wallet** page.

## Managing Strategies

### Strategies Monitoring
You will receive an execution report via Telegram every time a strategy runs.

### Fine-Tuning Strategies
- Check strategy status and edit/pause it on the **Strategy** page  
- Only **Instructions** can be edited; triggers cannot be modified  
- To change triggers, stop the current strategy and create a new one  

**Strategy Status:**

- **Active**: Currently running  
- **Completed**: Finished (e.g., one-time strategy)  
- **Canceled**: Stopped by user (cannot restart)  
- **Expired**: Passed scheduled end time  

### Checking Your Assets and Positions
- The **Wallet** page shows total assets and historical changes  
- Total assets include token holdings, Meteora positions, fees, and DLMM position rent  
- Current open positions are displayed and can be manually closed if needed
