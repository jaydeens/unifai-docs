<summary>How does our automated trading agent execute endgame strategies on Polymarket?</summary>

Our automated trading agent continuously monitors high-probability endgame opportunities before an event concludes. When the system detects a market that meets the strategy conditions, it automatically places orders and executes them fully on-chain with no manual intervention required.\
All trading activities and results are recorded in the dashboard, allowing users to view detailed logs anytime.\
Please note that while the agent doesn’t guarantee a 100% success rate for each individual trade, it maintains stable performance in highly liquid markets.

<details>

<summary>What assets are required to run the strategy?</summary>

You can deposit **USDC** or **USDC.e** on the **Polygon network** of your EVM wallet, along with a small amount of **POL** to cover gas fees.

<summary>Why can’t I see my transactions on the Polymarket website?</summary>

<figure><img src="../../.gitbook/assets/image (2).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

This is a common occurrence among automated trading tools. Other third-party bots (like Telegram trading bots) have similar behavior.\
When you connect your wallet to the Polymarket website, the platform creates a **proxy wallet** to execute trades.\
As a result, trading activity happens through that proxy wallet rather than your original connected wallet, which is why transactions don’t appear directly under your address on the Polymarket site.

To view your UnifAI wallet’s activity on Polymarket, visit [polymarketanalytics.com](https://polymarketanalytics.com/) and search for your wallet address. Under the **Traders** section, you can see all holdings and transaction records related to your address.

<details>

<summary>Will using this strategy affect potential airdrops?</summary>

Airdrop rules are determined by each platform and typically depend on metrics like account activity, trading volume, and community engagement.\
Using automated strategies actually **increases your account’s activity and trading volume**, which are key factors for most airdrop qualifications.

Although Polymarket hasn’t yet published clear airdrop criteria, from a fairness and contribution standpoint, both **manual and automated trading** should be recognized as valid participation that contributes to the platform’s ecosystem and should therefore qualify for airdrops.

For a more natural trading footprint, we recommend a **hybrid approach** combining automated and manual trading. While multiple accounts may use similar strategies, manual actions and unique trading behaviors will make each account distinct improving the chance of recognition in future airdrop evaluations.

<summary>How can I prove that my strategy is running and generating profit?</summary>

You can verify this in two ways:

1. **Check detailed records on the UnifAI dashboard**\
   Log into the UnifAI platform to view your open positions, pending orders, and trading history. Each entry includes execution logs, on-chain transaction hashes, timestamps, profit/loss data, and corresponding market analytics letting you confirm the strategy’s performance and activity in real time.
2. **Verify on-chain activity via third-party sites**\
   Visit [polymarketanalytics.com](https://polymarketanalytics.com/) and search your wallet address. Under **Traders**, you can see your full trade history and positions.\
   This allows you to cross-check UnifAI’s internal logs with independent on-chain data for full transparency.

By combining both methods, you can comprehensively track your strategy’s performance and verify every transaction.

<details>

<summary>What happens if a trade fails? Will I be charged?</summary>

No fees will be charged. Polymarket uses a **centralized matching engine**, meaning that if an order isn’t successfully matched, it won’t be executed on-chain and you won’t incur any fees.

Failed trades are common in endgame periods when market liquidity is low, especially if there are not enough sellers. This is normal and not a cause for concern.

Additionally, Polymarket enforces a **zero-fee trading policy**, so even successful trades incur no extra transaction fees.

</details>

<details>

<summary>How do I assess the ideal conditions and risks for the endgame strategy?</summary>

Endgame strategies perform best in markets with **deep liquidity and stable event outcomes** conditions that allow for efficient execution and reduced volatility.

In **low-liquidity markets or off-peak times**, order fills may be rare due to a lack of counterparties, which is normal behavior.

The primary risk lies in **result reversals before settlement**, which can lead to losses on open positions.\
To manage this, our strategy includes a **maximum trade-size cap** that limits exposure and diversifies risk, ensuring steady performance across varying market environments.

</details>

<details>

<summary>Are there public strategy templates or examples to get started?</summary>

Yes. The strategy creation page includes several **public templates and examples** that demonstrate common trading logics and scenarios. You can use these as references or modify them to quickly create and deploy your own automated strategy no coding required.

</details>

<details>

<summary>How can I maximize potential airdrop or reward opportunities?</summary>

To maximize potential airdrops or platform rewards, we recommend:

1. **Follow official announcements**\
   Stay updated on Polymarket’s and related platforms’ official posts for the latest airdrop criteria and eligibility details.
2. **Increase account activity**\
   Keep your trading consistent and engage actively on X (Twitter) with Polymarket-related content to earn visibility and badges.
3. **Ensure transparent and compliant trading**\
   Maintain clear, verifiable transaction records and avoid irregular activity. This helps with platform audits and serves as proof of genuine engagement.

Consistent, authentic trading behavior improves your chances of qualifying for future airdrops and incentives.

<details>

<summary>How can I test the strategy safely before scaling up?</summary>

You can start by using a **wallet with a small balance** to run the strategy in test mode.\
This allows you to observe how it operates, its trading frequency, and performance with minimal risk.

When you’re ready to scale up, simply **add more funds** to the same wallet. The system will automatically **adjust position sizes** based on your new balance no manual setup required.

</details>

<details>

<summary>How does UnifAI ensure wallet and fund security?</summary>

We take user security very seriously. UnifAI uses **Privy** for secure wallet management. All wallet private keys are **encrypted and managed by Privy**, and **UnifAI never has access to or stores your private keys**.

Even during key export, the private key is **end-to-end encrypted** between the user’s browser and Privy, ensuring that no third party including UnifAI can intercept or view it.

This architecture ensures your assets always remain under your control. UnifAI only executes trade logic; it never interacts with or holds any sensitive wallet information.
