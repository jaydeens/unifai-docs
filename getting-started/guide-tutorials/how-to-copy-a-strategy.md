Deposit at least **0.05 SOL** into your wallet if you are running a strategy on Solana. Always double-check the wallet address and network before transferring funds.

Monitor your strategy. Youâ€™ll receive execution reports on Telegram, and you can check your assets and positions on the **Wallet** page. You can also pause, stop, or close positions manually if needed.
